## SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS

I am a second-year post-bachelors student at Los Alamos National Laboratory with a keen interest in ecology and ecosystems science. My research background includes experience in a wide range of ecological field methods, statistics and data science, infectious disease transmission dynamics and forecasting, sequencing and bioinformatics, microbiology, and interdisciplinary work involving ethics and philosophy of science. I enjoy employing data-driven approaches to problem solving and communicating scientific concepts to diverse audiences through writing, visualization techniques and public speaking. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of deepening my current interests as well as exploring new skills and applications at a graduate level.

## EMPLOYMENT AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

`2021 - present`
Post bachelors student intern, __Los Alamos National Laboratory__, Los Alamos, New Mexico
- In my current position I am pursuing research in zoonotic disease ecology with a focus on West Nile virus vector and host dynamics, spatial and temporal transmission patterns, and data-driven forecast models, as well as research in sequencing, bioinformatics, and wildlife microbiome analysis.
- Staff scientist mentors: **Dr. Andrew Bartlow**, _Los Alamos National Laboratory, B-GEN: Genomics and Bioanalytics,_ Los Alamos, New Mexico, **Dr. Carrie Manore**, _Los Alamos National Laboratory, T-6: Theoretical Biology and Biophysics_, Los Alamos, New Mexico

-	Department of Biology Senior Thesis (2020-2021), Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. I conducted an original research project using a new experimental procedure to assess the potential of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in bioremediation of microplastics in aquatic environments.
Faculty Mentor: Dr. Brooke Jude (Bard College, Department of Biology)
-	Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU, 2019), Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, New York. As a successful REU applicant and program attendee I designed, executed, and presented a project titled “Diel distribution of zooplankton in the Sky Lakes,” aiming to infer spatial and temporal differences in zooplankton migration behavior and subsequent trophic changes in a set of 3 glacially formed lakes. 
Faculty Mentors: Dr. Kathleen Weathers (Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, G. Evelyn Hutchinson Chair in Ecology; Ecological Society of America, Elected President), Dr. David Richardson (SUNY New Paltz, Department of Biology; Environmental Geochemical Science Program, Faculty Advisor; Mohonk Preserve, Research Associate; Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Visiting Scientist)
